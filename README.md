# Bullseye iOS app - target the right number!

### The whole idea behind Bullseye game:
1. Aplication generates random number from 1 to 99,
2. User has to use a slider, targeting the best possible position of the generated number (slider's scale starts from 1 and ends on 100),
3. After hiting "Hit me" button aplication calculates points (100 - (Target value - User value)). User is also able to start another round,
4. Each round's result is stored in "Leaderboard",
5. Number of rounds and total score is being displayed on the main app view.
